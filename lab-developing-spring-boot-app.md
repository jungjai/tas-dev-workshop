# Building a Spring Boot Application

In this lab we'll build and deploy a simple https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/[Spring Boot] application to Cloud Foundry whose sole purpose is to reply with a standard greeting.

optinally, you can reference the [complete sample app on github](https://github.com/myminseok/spring-cloud-sample/tree/master/lab-building-spring-boot-app/complete/cloud-native-spring)

### Prerequisites
[app prerequisites](lab-prerequisites-app.md)

## Create a new app

### 1. Build a app template on spring initializr 
While we could visit spring initializr https://start.spring.io to create a new Spring Boot project, we will start with a skeleton
- project: mvn or gradle
- language: java
- spring boot: 2.3.* : [app prerequisites](lab-prerequisites-app.md)
- project metadata> name: cloud-native-spring
- project metadata> packaging: jar
- project metadata> java: 8
- dependencies: `web`

### 2. Download as zip 
### 3. Open a Terminal (e.g., _cmd_ or _bash_ shell)
### 4. Unzip 
### 5. Open this project in your editor/IDE of choice.

## Develop the app

### 1. Add an Endpoint
Within your editor/IDE complete the following steps:

- Create a new class named MyController under the package com.example.cloudnativespring;
 package
- edit MyController.java

```
package com.example.cloudnativespring;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;

@RestController
public class MyController {

    @GetMapping("/")
    public String hello() {
        return "Hello World!";
    }

}
```

### 2. Build the application
Return to the Terminal session you opened previously and make sure your working directory.  we'll package the application as an executable artifact (that can be run on its own because it will include all transitive dependencies along with embedding a servlet container)
```
  gradle clean build
  gradle clean build --exclude-task test

  mvn clean package
  mvn clean package -DskipTests
  
```

### 3. Run the application
Now we're ready to run the application
```
  gradle bootRun
  mvn spring-boot:run
```

You should see the application start up an embedded Apache Tomcat server on port 8080 (review terminal output):

```

### 4. Testing the application on local PC
open web browser and access url http://localhost:8080/
or
```
curl http://localhost:8080/
```


#### Using Curl
Edit the curl command below with your information. 

```
  curl  http://<YOUR-APP-URL>/
```

### Using WebBrowser

(optional)  If you use chrome, you might want to install a JSON formatter like JSONView: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonview/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc

#### (optional) Using Postman
install postman: https://www.getpostman.com/. On the Builder page, you will set up your request.


#### Stop the application. 
In the terminal window type *Ctrl + C*


## Deploy the app to TAS
We've built and run the application locally.  Now we'll deploy it to Cloud Foundry. 

### Target and login on TAS
```
cf api https://api.TAS-SYSTEM-DOMAIN-URL --skip-ssl-validation

cf login

or 

cf login -a https://api.TAS-SYSTEM-DOMAIN-URL -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD -o ORG -s SPACE
```

## Push application into Cloud Foundry
Use cf push --help to determine how to push your app. Be sure to do the following:
- Name your app .
- Push the jar file by providing the ‘-p’ flag pointing to the jar file on your laptop
- put unique-app-domain-name by providing '-n' flag. 
- Create one instance(default)
- Allocate 750M of memory
- Use the java_buildpack buildpack
- Use --random-route to avoid route collisions. It appends two random words to the name of your app as a dev tool to help avoid route collisions. DO NOT use this in production.

```
cf push APP_NAME -p /PATH/to/the/jar  -n <unique-app-domain-name>

```
*Congratulations!* You’ve just completed your first Spring Boot application.

*The End of this lab*
